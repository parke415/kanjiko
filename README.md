# **Kanjiko (漢字庫)**
> "Gotta Learn 'Em All!" - Andrew Parke

*Kanjiko* is an app that makes it fun and convenient to collect characters as you learn them—great for students of Japanese, Korean, and any flavor of Chinese!

## *Getting Started:*
* Log in with your Google account below the home banner.
* Click on **[+]** in the character list (sorted by total stroke count) to add your first character.
* Fill out the character's basic properties following the prompt.
* When viewing a character, you may fill out forms to add components (compound characters only) and readings in multiple languages (both lists may be dumped).
* You may edit or delete any added characters.
* By default, newly added characters are not yet learned; mark a character as learned by clicking on the LEARNED button.
* Click [**here**](https://kanjiko.herokuapp.com/) to enter the world of kanji! ([view project planning](https://trello.com/b/qMRaUG0T/kanjiko))

## *Technologies Used:*
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Passport
* Google OAuth

## *Future Enhancements ("Icebox Items"):*
* Linking components to their corresponding character entries (if extant)
* Sorting the character list by time added, component, reading, and comprehension, in addition to the default stroke-based order
* Listing all characters of which a given character is a constituent component within that character's details
